YAKS is Cloud-Native BDD testing or simply "Yet Another Kubernetes Service".

# What is "YAKS"?

YAKS is a test automation platform to run your tests as Cloud-Native resources. This means it runs natively on
 [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) and is specifically designed 
 to verify your serverless and Microservice components.
  
The tests that you write with YAKS follow the BDD (Behavior Driven Development) concepts so you can run any 
[Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) (Given-When-Then) feature file as Pod in your cluster.

YAKS provides a specific operator that leverages the Operator SDK to perform operations on Kubernetes resources. Each time you provide
a test as a [custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) the operator takes care on
preparing the JVM test runtime and executes the test as a Pod in the cluster.
  
The test framework also brings a set of ready-to-use [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) steps so you can just start writing 
your feature files and run them. 

## Why would you want to do that?

Why would you want to run tests as Cloud-Native resources in Kubernetes? Both Kubernetes and OpenShift have become standard target platforms for serverless 
and microservices architectures. Developing those architectures is different compared to what we have done for decades before that. 

Writing a serverless application for instance with [Camel K](https://camel.apache.org/projects/camel-k/) is very declarative. As a developer you write a single 
Camel route and run this via the Camel K operator in the Kubernetes cluster. In this approach the unit testing part that we were used to in so many years 
is more and more transformed into pure integration testing and end-to-end testing given by the nature of serverless architectures.

Sample: _Camel K integration.groovy_
{% highlight groovy %}
// expose a rest endpoint that routes messages to a Kafka topic
rest().post("/resources")
  .route()
    .to("kafka:messages")
    
// transform all messages and publish them on a HTTP endpoint
from("kafka:messages")
  .transform()... // any kind of transformation
  .to("http://myendpoint/messages")
{% endhighlight %}

We always run the Camel K integration source within the target infrastructure including messaging transports, databases and other services. It is only natural 
to also move the verifying tests into this infrastructure in order to run the tests as part of the Kubernetes cluster. This way the tests can make use of all
Kubernetes services including access to internal services, too. Also the tests are able to simulate 3rd party services or other microservices that are part
of the processing logic in the Camel K route.

## How does it work? 

YAKS provides a Kubernetes operator and a set of CRDs (custom resources) that we need to install in the cluster. The best way to install YAKS is to use the _yaks_ CLI tools 
that you can download on the YAKS [github release pages](https://github.com/citrusframework/yaks/releases).

Simply run:
```
$ yaks install
```         

This command prepares your Kubernetes cluster for running tests with YAKS. It will take care of installing the YAKS CRDs, setting up privileges and create the 
operator in the current namespace.

Important: in some cluster configurations, you need to be a cluster admin to install a CRD (itâ€™s a operation that should be done only once for the entire cluster). 
The _yaks_ binary will help you troubleshoot. If you want to work on a development cluster like Minishift or Minikube, you can easily follow the dev cluster setup guide.
                                                                              
Once the cluster is prepared and the operator installed in the current namespace we can start to write a first BDD feature:

File: _http-to-kafka.feature_
{% highlight gherkin %}
Feature: Http To Kafka

  Background:
    Given URL: https://camelk-integration.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example/api/resources
  
  Scenario: Get a result from API
    When send GET /
    Then receive HTTP 200 OK

{% endhighlight %}

You can run the test with:
```
$ yaks test http-to-kafka.feature
```                              

When you run this you will be provided with the test output from the Pod that is running your test in the current namespace on Kubernetes.

```
$ yaks test http-to-kafka.feature

Also you can revisit the test Pod outcome with:

```
$ kubectl get tests
```                

This is an example of output you should get:

```
NAME            PHASE
http-to-kafka   Passed
```

The test we just have run calls the sample Camel K integration that we have seen before. It invokes a Http request on the Camel K service and verifies the _Http 200 OK_ response code. The
test uses some of the ready-to-use steps for handling Http communication provided by YAKS. But before we have a closer look at the predefined YAKS steps that you can use in a feature file 
we have a closer look at what happens behind the scenes when running this test.

[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/yaks-architecture.jpg" alt="YAKS architecture"/>]({{ site.baseurl }}/)

The `yaks` tool will sync your test code with a Kubernetes custom resource of Kind _Test_. The resource is named `http-to-kafka` (after the file name) in the current namespace. So every time 
you run the test the custom resource is updated and executed.

The YAKS operator is the component that makes all this possible by configuring all Kubernetes resources needed for running your tests.

Now lets have a look at the predefined YAKS step implementations that you can use out-of-the box.

# YAKS test steps

The test framework provides several ready-to-use [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) steps that you can just use in your feature files. These steps should enable you to verify serverless applications by
exchanging data over various messaging transports. Have a look at the predefined steps we have so far:

 Module | Description
 --- | ---
 yaks-standard      | Basic steps (e.g. for logging messages to the console)
 yaks-http          | Call Http REST endpoints and verify the response content
 yaks-swagger       | Import Swagger OpenAPI specifications and use defined operations and test data to call Http REST endpoints
 yaks-jdbc          | Connect to a database for updating data or verifying query result sets
 yaks-camel         | Create, start and stop [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/) routes as part of the test. This opens access to all __200+__ Camel components that you can use in your test!
 yaks-camel-k       | Create and verify Camel K integrations in a test

The list of ready-to-use steps is constantly growing and you can also write your own steps and use them in a YAKS test! Have a look at the [examples](https://github.com/citrusframework/yaks/tree/master/examples) 
to see all those steps in action.

The steps provided in YAKS are implemented using the integration test framework [Citrus](https://citrusframework.org/). 

Citrus itself also has some ready-to-use steps (e.g. [Selenium steps](https://citrusframework.org/citrus/reference/2.8.0/html/index.html#selenium-steps) and 
[Docker steps](https://citrusframework.org/citrus/reference/2.8.0/html/index.html#docker-steps)). You can also use these steps as part of YAKS testing. 

# Demo

The following demo video shows an example of what you can do with YAKS. It has the YAKS operator already installed and invokes a system under test via Http 
verifying the response content. It continues to more complex scenarios where the test uses a Swagger OpenAPI specification for generating requests and test data.
