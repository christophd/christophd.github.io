My name is Christoph Deppisch and I am working as a Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat. In this blog I would like to 
share my experience with Middleware Integration projects and test automation. In particular the content will be about 
Apache Camel, ActiveMQ, JBoss Fuse, Kubernetes, BDD and Citrus.

Middleware integration is something we need in almost every data processing system. Testing is an essential thing to 
do from the very beginning and test automation is the only reliable way to ensure a stable software. This is my strong 
belief that I would like to share and discuss with you.
